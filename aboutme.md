- I'm a fifth-year Ph. D. candidate at [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Minyi Guo](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~guo-my/).
- My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning and data mining, particularly in **recommender systems** and **graph data mining**. I also dabble in **natural language processing** and **reinforcement learning**.
- I am about to be a postdoctoral researcher in [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) from spring 2019, supervised by Prof. [Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/).
